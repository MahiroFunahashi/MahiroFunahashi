10 GOOD PRACTICES I FOLLOW IN CODE MANAGEMENT:

1. Commit early, commit often; every commit provides a rollback position
2. Inspect changes before committing
3. Remember the axe-murderer when writing commit messages
4. While working in a team, must commit your changes – you can’t delegate it
5. Versioning Database
6. Making extensive – detailed notes in the check-in comments about why the changes were made
7. Ensure the working file is from the latest version of the source file
8. Only Check-out the file being worked upon
9. Review every change before committing; utilize the diff function!
10. Use the ignore button for files that should not be committed, consider adding pre-commit filters to prevent the wrong kinds of files (such as accidental check-in of personal user settings docs) from entering the source control
